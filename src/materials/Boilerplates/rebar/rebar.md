# Technology stack

## Client stack

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [found](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found)                    | Extensible route-based routing for React applications. |
| [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/)             | A query language for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client‚Äêserver applications. |
| [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/)                                      | JSS is a more powerful abstraction over CSS. It uses JavaScript as a language to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. |

| [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)                | The right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. |

| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)                               | Event-driven, non-blocking I/O runtime based on JavaScript that is lightweight and efficient. |
| [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)                 | A logger for just about everything. |

## Development tools

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Babel](http://babeljs.io)                                      | Transpiles ESX to ESX and performs relay transformations. |
| [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)      | Run multiple commands concurrently. |
| [ESLint](https://eslint.org)                                    | A fully pluggable tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. |

| [React Hot Loader](gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)         | Allows tweaking of React components in real time. |
| [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)                             | Bundles npm packages, application Java Script, CSS, images, etc. into bundles. |




# Setup

## Development Environment Setup

The setup is for OS X only. Prerequisites:

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** minimum version as specified in [`package.json`](package.json#L101).  
* **yarn** run `npm install -g yarn`

## Setting up Elassandra in docker

### Setup

```
docker pull strapdata/elassandra:6.2.3.4
docker run -d -p 9042:9042 --name=elassie strapdata/elassandra:6.2.3.4
```

### Start/Stop

```
docker start elassie
docker stop elassie
```

### Troubleshooting

```
docker run --privileged -it --link elassie --rm strapdata/elassandra cqlsh elassie
docker logs elassie
```

### Cleanup

```
docker stop elassie
docker rm elassie
```

## Setup on local development machine

In order to set up the project locally, perform the following steps:

| Action                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `git clone https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar.git` | Clone from github. Alternatively, you can download the source and update in some different way. |
| `yarn`                    | Install node packages. |
| `yarn setup-local`        | Set up default configuration for running the boilerplate. |
| Edit `.env`               | Set database server / name, secrets, API keys. etc. |
| `yarn setup-database`     | Creates Cassandra schema. |

In addition to the above, you might want to specify `JWT_SECRET` by modifying the `.env` file. This step can be skipped if you do not care about the actual security and simply want to get the project running.



# Development

## Running in development mode

In order to develop, three servers need to be started:

* Web server.
* Webpack server.
* Relay compiler (watching).

This can be done with one command: `yarn dev`.
To open the web app: navigate to `http://localhost:28605`, or whatever IP was assigned when running `yarn update-ip`.

## Running through Local Tunnel

In some cases it is necessary to make your development environment publicly available under HTTPS. The service [Local Tunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) allows you to easily share a Rebar project on your local development machine without messing with DNS and firewall settings. In order to use LocalTunnel, edit [_configuration/rb-devtunnel/tunnels.json](https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar/blob/0750afbfd6320f814131ae86d909384d9a153f1b/units/_configuration/rb-devtunnel/tunnels.json#L10). Replace the value of

```
'subdomain': 'replace-with-your-own-domain'
```

with your preferred value. Please notice that LocalTunnel allocates subdomain names on a first come first serve basis, for the duration of using the service. You can also add headers that will be passed to your Rebar server. In order to run LocalTunnel with the rest of the development environment, use

```
yarn dev-t
```

Then you can navigate to `https://replace-with-your-own-domain.localtunnel.me`.



# Production

In order to run rebar in production-like mode you can:

```
$ yarn build-deployment
...
$ export NODE_ENV=production
$ node ./deployment/units/rb-base-server/server
```

A production  setup would include the `deployment` directory, with appropriate `.env` file, and running `units/rb-base-server/server` in some sort of fashion.
